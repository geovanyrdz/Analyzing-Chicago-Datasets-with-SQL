# Analyzing-Chicago-Datasets-with-SQL


This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for a graded assignment as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. The project involves analyzing three Chicago datasets using Python and SQL.

## Overview

The project aims to:

1. Understand three datasets related to Chicago.
2. Load these datasets into tables in an SQLite database.
3. Execute SQL queries to answer specific assignment questions.

### Datasets Used

The datasets are sourced from the City of Chicago's Data Portal:

1. **Census Data**: Selected socioeconomic indicators in Chicago neighborhoods.
